My Portfolio Website

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work as a full-stack developer. I built it from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

What's in it?

I've included everything you'd want to know about me professionally:
- About me and my background
- My education (BTech in CSE with 8.5 CGPA!)
- Technical skills and the tools I work with
- Projects I've worked on
- My experience at Dream Tech Training Institute
- Ways to get in touch with me

Tech stuff I used

Pretty straightforward stack:
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling (with some cool glassmorphism effects)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
- No frameworks - just good old web technologies

The design is fully responsive, so it looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops.

How to run it locally

If you want to check it out on your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/picolosensai09/portfolio-website.git
cd portfolio-website
```

Then just open `index.html` in your browser. Or if you have Python installed:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Hosting on GitHub Pages

I've deployed this on GitHub Pages. Here's how I did it (in case you want to do something similar):

1. Created a new repo on GitHub
2. Pushed all my files there
3. Went to Settings > Pages
4. Selected "Deploy from a branch" and chose main branch
5. That's it! GitHub gave me a URL

The site is live at: `https://picolosensai09.github.io/portfolio-website`

File structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html     # Main page
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css     # All the styling
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js      # JavaScript for animations and interactions  
â”œâ”€â”€ images/        # Profile picture and other images
â””â”€â”€ README.md      # This file
```

Things I'm proud of

- Clean, modern design that actually looks professional
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Works great on mobile (spent a lot of time on this!)
- Fast loading - no heavy frameworks or libraries
- Contact form that actually works

Want to customize it?

Feel free to fork it! The code is pretty clean and commented. Main things you'd want to change:

- Update the personal info in `index.html`
- Change colors in the CSS custom properties section
- Add your own projects and experience
- Replace my photo with yours
